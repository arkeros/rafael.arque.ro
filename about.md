Studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Creator of [Omegan](http://omegan.net). Currently working at Virtual AD. Huge nerd.

Rafael Arquero is a designer living and working in Badalona. Originally from Wisconsin, he freelanced his way through high school and college before dropping out and moving to California to work at a design firm, ZURB, in 2007. There he designed and developed dozens of projects with clients large and small, including a website for Britney Spears. In early 2010, after a two-and-a-half year stint at ZURB, he left to become a product designer at Twitter.

At Twitter, he worked on numerous projects including the Promoted Products campaign tools and badges, Twitter.com during #NewNewTwitter, the Twitter Help Center, and several internal tools. He also created the popular open source front-end toolkit Bootstrap with @fat.

In late 2012, he left Twitter to join the folks at GitHub.
